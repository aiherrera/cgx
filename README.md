## Quickstart

Install the CGX CLI as a global CLI.

```shell
npm install -g cgx

cd <your-repo-location>

# Then you run
cgx
```

Or just use via npx:

```shell
cd <your-repo-location>

# Then you run
npx cgx
```

This should start the CLI and ask for questions about which files you want to add!

## Example

Generate all files example:
```shell
   ____    ____  __  __
  / ___|  / ___| \ \/ /
 | |     | |  _   \  /
 | |___  | |_| |  /  \
  \____|  \____| /_/\_\
